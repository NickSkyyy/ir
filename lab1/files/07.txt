When I first look at the cartoon, I can't help laughing at the hen who seems to be seriouslymaking a foolis h announcement to the public that she always lays eggs, smooth and roundand never without eggwhite and yolk in side the shell. However, when I start to study thecartoon more carefully, I find something significant in it and gradually I come to understandthe author's intention.
　　Nowadays, almost all trades and professions are repeatedly making sincere promises to people: government people assure that they are noble and clean and will serve people heart andsoulmer chants smilingly swear that the products they sell are of superior quality, genuineinstead of false, life-time maintenance guaranteed and the cheapest market price; advertiserstake pains to recommend miracle drugs and make-youbeautiful cosmetics, etc. Year afteryear, such promises are repeated. I wonder why they take so much trouble to boast oudlyabout their obligations and duties. People believed them at first, but gradually becameawakened because they have found some dishonesty in such bombing promises.
　　"Actions speak louder than words." The hen is foolish enough to make her egg-promise, whyshouldn't those nonsense- maker s become cleverer?
