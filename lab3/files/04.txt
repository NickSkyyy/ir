During the recent years, countless small busines ses have closed their doors and gonebankrupt. The corne r grocer's , the small dress shop, the beauty salon, all are victims ofmarket competition. Most of them are replaced by other small businesses that temporarilyfill the needs of the neighbourhood but frequently end up, sharing the same fate ofdissolution. More often, the market served by small businesses is taken over by large storesand shops. Businesses like the corner groceries and the dress shops have gone to bigdepartment stores and supermarkets, which not only keep adequate store and variety, butalso provide better environment and service.
　　Appar ently, it is increasingly difficult for small businesses to succeed in the present complexeconomic structure based, as it is, on small profit margins and tremendou s sales volume. Lackof enough fund and poor management may be the chief cause of this tragedy. In addition, thequality of their commodities often causes suspicion of the customers as many smallbusinesses are found to sell fake products for more profit, thus earning themselves an evilreputation. As to shopping environment and convenient service, they are unmentionable. All of the above speed up their bankruptcy.
　　Today, with the establishment of more and more groups and big corporations, how smallbusinesses can survive in the tide of the market competitive economy has become a hotsocial issue.
