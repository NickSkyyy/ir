My father used to talk to me about his five siblings. He used to say that I was unfortunate thatI had none. And I used to envy him and wonder how nice it would be to have a houseful ofbrothers and sisters. I also used to wonder what would happen to me if I were to lose myparents.
　　Frankly speaking, I do not have to share anything with anybody. I own all my parents' love. Ican ask for anything I want. I always wear new clothes and eat the best food. Since my parentsspend all their money on me, I can study at the best university of the country.
　　Lucky as I am, I now and then feel very lonely and I have nobody to complain about myloneliness. How I long for a quarrel with my brothers and sisters! Of course I have classmatesand friends, but they are different. Sometimes I feel so pessimistic that after my parents leavethe world, I will have no blood relatives left to share with me the fond memories of my parents. Furthermore, I am likely to become selfish while I realize the world is for sharing.
　　So, I am happy but lonely; I am fortunate but piteous; I am loved but spoiled; I am well-bredbut selfish, because I am the only child of the family.
